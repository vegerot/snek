🐍 Snek Benchmark Suite - Implementation Summary
===============================================

COMPLETED FEATURES:
✅ benchmark.zig - Complete benchmark implementation (267 lines)
✅ 4 comprehensive benchmark categories:
   - Snake Movement (100K iterations) 
   - Collision Detection (1M iterations)
   - Food Generation (1M iterations)  
   - Complete Game Simulation (10K ticks with AI)

✅ Headless operation (no graphics dependencies)
✅ Statistical analysis (5 runs per benchmark, min/max/avg)
✅ Build system integration (build.zig + Makefile)
✅ CI/automation support (run_benchmarks_ci.sh)
✅ Comprehensive documentation (BENCHMARK.md)
✅ Validation tools (test_benchmark.sh, validate_benchmark.py)

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- Snake Movement: < 5ms for 100K iterations
- Collision Detection: < 10ms for 1M checks
- Food Generation: < 2ms for 1M generations
- Complete Simulation: < 50ms for 10K ticks

USAGE:
make benchmark           # Run via Makefile
zig build benchmark      # Run via Zig build system  
./run_benchmarks_ci.sh   # Automated CI runner

KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
- Pure Zig implementation without external dependencies
- Isolated game logic for performance testing
- Configurable iteration counts for different environments
- Multiple validation layers (syntax, logic, integration)
- Performance-focused optimizations (minimal allocations)

The benchmark suite is production-ready and can be used to:
- Track performance regressions
- Optimize game engine components
- Compare performance across hardware
- Validate code changes
